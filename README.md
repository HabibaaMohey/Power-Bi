This dashboard offers a comprehensive and visually appealing overview of a telecom company's data. It provides essential insights into customer churn and retention strategies.



# ðŸ“Š Dashboard 1: Customer Overview

The first dashboard provides us with a comprehensive snapshot of our customer base. With just a few clicks, we can explore vital information such as total customers in each city, contract preferences, age range distribution, and customer status filtering. By filtering customers based on churn status, we can identify potential issues related to specific cities, age ranges, contracts, and even service preferences (phone or internet).

# ðŸ“Š Dashboard 2: Churn Analysis

Moving on to the second dashboard, we dive deeper into churned customers. By filtering churned customers by city and contract type, we gain valuable context for analyzing their specific circumstances. We can uncover churn reasons by examining the offers they received, satisfaction levels, and any issues related to internet or phone services. Additionally, we analyze the satisfaction levels and feedback from our unchurned customers to proactively address their needs and mitigate the risk of churn.
